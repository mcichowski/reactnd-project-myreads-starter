# MyReads Project

MyReads allows you to keep an overview over the literature you're reading right now, you want to read, and you definitely have to read in the future.

The search function, which allows you to add new books, supports the following search terms right now [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md)


## TL;DR

To run MyReads you have to execute:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` | `yarn install`
* start the application with `npm start` | `yarn start`
